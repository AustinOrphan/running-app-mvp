# Start the application.
# The backend is not compiled to JS (tsconfig has noEmit: true — `tsc` only
# type-checks; `vite build` emits the frontend into dist/). So we run the
# TypeScript entrypoint directly with tsx, exactly as `npm run dev` does but
# without --watch. tsx is a devDependency, so the image must carry devDeps.
