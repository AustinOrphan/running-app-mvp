### [📊 Plan 3: Static Analysis & Code Quality](./PLAN_3_Static_Analysis_Code_Quality.md)

**Priority**: 🟡 Medium (After Plans 1-2)  
**Complexity**: 🟡 Medium  
**Time**: 2-4 days

**Goal**: Implement advanced static analysis to identify and refactor complex, error-prone code

**Key MCP Tools**: `serena`, `gemini-cli`, `Context7`, `memory`, `filesystem`

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ Unified ESLint configuration across client/server
- ✅ Zero linting errors with enhanced rule set
- ✅ 3+ high-complexity functions refactored
- ✅ Anti-patterns eliminated throughout codebase

---

### [🧪 Plan 4: Intelligent Test Coverage](./PLAN_4_Intelligent_Test_Coverage.md)

**Priority**: 🟢 Medium (After Plans 1-3)  
**Complexity**: 🟡 Medium  
**Time**: 2-3 days

**Goal**: Strategically improve test coverage by targeting critical, complex, under-tested areas

**Key MCP Tools**: `gemini-cli`, `serena`, `memory`, `filesystem`, `todos`

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 5%+ meaningful coverage increase in critical modules
- ✅ 3+ high-complexity functions reach >80% coverage
- ✅ Critical path coverage increased to 90%+
- ✅ Risk-based testing approach established

## 🛠️ MCP Tool Integration Strategy

### Systematic Tool Usage Across Plans

| Tool             | Plan 1 | Plan 2 | Plan 3 | Plan 4 | Primary Use Case                             |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **`serena`**     | ✅     | ✅     | ✅✅✅ | ✅✅   | Semantic code analysis, complexity detection |
| **`gemini-cli`** | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | ✅✅✅ | Command execution, analysis, strategy design |
| **`Context7`**   |        | ✅✅✅ | ✅✅   | ✅     | Library documentation, migration guides      |
| **`memory`**     |        |        | ✅✅   | ✅✅✅ | Knowledge graphs, relationship mapping       |
| **`filesystem`** | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | File operations, configuration management    |
| **`todos`**      | ✅✅   | ✅✅   | ✅     | ✅✅   | Task tracking and progress management        |

### Tool Synergy Patterns

**Intelligence Gathering**:

```
serena (code analysis) → gemini-cli (strategy) → memory (relationships)
```

**Implementation**:

```
filesystem (read) → gemini-cli (transform) → filesystem (write) → todos (track)
```

**Validation**:

```
gemini-cli (test) → serena (verify) → todos (complete)
```
