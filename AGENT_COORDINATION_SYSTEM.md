   Path: AGENT_COORDINATION/progress/phase1-infrastructure-status.md
   Content: Initial status template
   ```

#### **During Phase 1 Execution**
**Status Update Requirements**:

1. **After Environment Analysis (Step 1.3)**
   ```markdown
   Status Update Required:
   - Current test infrastructure state documented
   - Blockers identified and prioritized
   - Timeline estimate updated
   ```

2. **After Configuration Fixes (Step 2.3)**
   ```markdown

   - Test environment validation results
   ```

3. **Before Phase 1 Completion**
   ```markdown
   Final Status Required:
   - All infrastructure components functional
   - No blocking issues remaining
   - Phase 2 readiness confirmed
   - Go/no-go decision for Phase 2 parallel deployment
   ```

#### **Phase 1 Completion Gate**
**Requirements for Phase 2 Authorization**:
- [ ] Infrastructure Agent completion report created
- [ ] All test frameworks operational
- [ ] Database setup working correctly
- [ ] Coverage reporting functional
- [ ] No critical issues in tracking system

---

### **Phase 2: Parallel Agent Coordination**
**Coordination Requirements**: 4 agents executing in parallel with resource conflict prevention

#### **Pre-Phase 2 Coordination**
1. **Resource Allocation Verification**
   ```markdown
   Tool Required: mcp__filesystem__write_file
   Path: AGENT_COORDINATION/coordination/RESOURCE_ALLOCATION.md
   Content:
   - Authentication Agent: routes/auth.ts, tests/integration/api/auth.comprehensive.test.ts
   - Runs Agent: routes/runs.ts, tests/integration/api/runs.comprehensive.test.ts
   - Goals Agent: routes/goals.ts, tests/integration/api/goals.comprehensive.test.ts
   - Middleware Agent: middleware/*.ts, tests/integration/middleware/middleware.comprehensive.test.ts
   ```

2. **Dependency Tracking Setup**
   ```markdown
   Tool Required: mcp__filesystem__write_file
   Path: AGENT_COORDINATION/coordination/DEPENDENCY_TRACKING.md
   Content:
   - All agents depend on Phase 1 completion
   - No inter-agent dependencies within Phase 2
   - Phase 3 depends on ALL Phase 2 agents completing
   ```

#### **Parallel Agent Status Tracking**
**Real-Time Coordination Protocol**:

1. **Agent Progress Updates**
   ```markdown
   Frequency: After each major step completion
   Method: Individual agent status file updates
   Format: Standardized progress template
   Trigger: Any significant milestone or issue
   ```

2. **Cross-Agent Conflict Detection**
   ```markdown
   Monitor: File modification conflicts
   Alert: Any agent attempting to modify another's assigned files
   Resolution: Immediate coordination and conflict resolution
   ```

3. **Quality Gate Monitoring**
   ```markdown
   Track: Each agent's coverage progress toward 80% target
   Monitor: Test suite pass/fail status
   Alert: Any agent falling behind schedule or failing tests
   ```

#### **Phase 2 Status Templates**

**Individual Agent Status Template**:
```markdown
# [Agent Name] Status Report

## Current Progress
- **Phase**: [Phase Number]
- **Step**: [Current Step]
- **Status**: [In Progress/Blocked/Completed]
- **Coverage**: [Current Coverage %]
- **Tests**: [Pass/Fail Count]

## Completed Tasks
- [ ] Task 1 - [Status]
- [ ] Task 2 - [Status]

## Current Task
- **Task**: [Current Task Description]
- **Expected Completion**: [Time Estimate]
- **Blockers**: [Any Issues]

## Next Steps
1. [Next Task]
2. [Following Task]

## Issues/Concerns
- [Any issues requiring attention]

- **Test Count**: [Number of tests added]
- **Test Status**: [All passing/X failing]

**Last Updated**: [Timestamp]

```

#### **Issue Escalation Protocol**

**Issue Severity Levels**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Blocking multiple agents or entire deployment
2. **HIGH**: Blocking single agent or affecting timeline
3. **MEDIUM**: Affecting quality but not timeline
4. **LOW**: Minor issues, documentation needed

**Escalation Procedure**:
```markdown
1. Agent identifies issue
2. Agent documents in individual issues file
3. If CRITICAL/HIGH: Update GLOBAL_ISSUES.md immediately
4. If blocking: Other agents notified to pause/adjust
5. Resolution tracked with timeline updates
```

---

### **Phase 3: Integration Coordination**
**Coordination Requirements**: Single agent with all Phase 2 dependencies

#### **Pre-Phase 3 Validation**
1. **Phase 2 Completion Verification**
   ```markdown
   Requirements Check:
   - All 4 Phase 2 agents completed
   - All coverage targets achieved (‚â•80% each)
   - No failing tests in any component
   - All agent completion reports created
   ```

2. **System Integration Readiness**
   ```markdown
   Validation Required:
   - Complete system coverage baseline measured
   - All individual components tested
   - Integration test environment prepared
   - Performance testing infrastructure ready
   ```

#### **Phase 3 Coordination Points**
1. **Cross-System Validation**
   - Monitor: Integration between all Phase 2 components
   - Validate: Data flow and consistency across systems
   - Confirm: No regressions from integration testing

2. **Final System Validation**
   - Execute: Complete end-to-end system testing
   - Measure: Final coverage and performance metrics
   - Confirm: System ready for production deployment
