# Fifteenth Critical Fix: Label Mismatch Fix Results

## Issue Identified

CreateGoalModal tests were failing with `TestingLibraryElementError: Unable to find a label with the text of: [Label] *` errors because tests expected labels with asterisks but components use labels without asterisks.

## Root Cause Analysis

- Tests were looking for form labels with asterisks (e.g., "Goal Title _", "Target Value _", "Start Date _", "End Date _")
- Actual CreateGoalModal component uses labels without asterisks (e.g., `label='Goal Title'`)
- This mismatch caused multiple test failures when trying to find form elements by label text
- The close button test was also looking for '✕' but the component uses 'Close modal' as the accessible name

## Solution Implemented

Updated all label selectors in CreateGoalModal.test.tsx to match actual component labels:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Form field labels** - Removed asterisks from all label selectors:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   screen.getByLabelText('Goal Title *');
   screen.getByLabelText('Target Value *');
   screen.getByLabelText('Start Date *');
   screen.getByLabelText('End Date *');

   // After
   screen.getByLabelText('Goal Title');
   screen.getByLabelText('Target Value');
   screen.getByLabelText('Start Date');
   screen.getByLabelText('End Date');
   ```

2. **Close button selector** - Updated to use accessible name:

   ```typescript
   // Before
   screen.getByRole('button', { name: '✕' });

   // After
   screen.getByRole('button', { name: 'Close modal' });
   ```

## Technical Details

- Used regex replacements to systematically fix all occurrences
- Fixed recovery from a broken regex replacement that replaced labels with literal `$1`
- Ensured all label references throughout the test file were updated consistently

## Test Results

### Before Fix:

- Failed Tests: 131 (from CSS selector fix)
- Pass Rate: 86.2%
- Multiple TestingLibraryElementError failures for label mismatches

### After Fix:

- **Total Tests**: 946
- **Passed**: 837 (up from 815)
- **Failed**: 108 (down from 131)
- **Skipped**: 1
- **New Pass Rate**: 88.5% (837/946)

### Impact Analysis:

- **Tests Fixed**: 22 fewer failed tests (131 → 108)
- **Improvement**: +2.3% absolute improvement in pass rate (+22 tests)
- **CreateGoalModal Tests**: Fixed all label-related test failures in this component

### Specific Test Fixes:

1. **Modal Visibility tests**: Fixed close button selector test
2. **Form Fields tests**: Fixed all form field label queries
3. **Date Handling tests**: Fixed start/end date field selectors
4. **Form Validation tests**: Fixed field selection for validation tests
5. **Accessibility tests**: Fixed label verification tests

## Files Modified:

- `tests/unit/components/CreateGoalModal.test.tsx` - Updated all label selectors to remove asterisks and fix close button selector

## Next Steps:

Continue systematic approach to identify and fix the sixteenth critical issue. With 108 tests still failing, we need to:

1. Analyze remaining failures to identify patterns
2. Focus on the next most common failure type
3. Continue until reaching 100% pass rate

## Pattern Established:

This fix establishes the importance of:

- Verifying actual component implementation before writing tests
- Using accurate selectors that match component accessibility attributes
- Testing through accessible queries rather than visual symbols
- Maintaining consistency between test expectations and component reality
