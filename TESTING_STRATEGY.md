## Testing Standards and Guidelines

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('Feature/Component', () => {
  // Setup
  beforeAll(() => {
    /* Global setup */
  });
  beforeEach(() => {
    /* Test setup */
  });

  // Happy path tests
  describe('success scenarios', () => {
    it('should handle valid input correctly', () => {});
  });

  // Error cases
  describe('error scenarios', () => {
    it('should handle invalid input gracefully', () => {});
  });

  // Edge cases
  describe('edge cases', () => {
    it('should handle boundary conditions', () => {});
  });

  // Cleanup
  afterEach(() => {
    /* Test cleanup */
  });
  afterAll(() => {
    /* Global cleanup */
  });
});
```

### Naming Conventions

- Test files: `*.test.ts` or `*.spec.ts`
- Test descriptions: Clear, action-oriented
- Test data: Prefixed with `test` or `mock`
- Fixtures: Organized by feature/domain

### Data Management

- Use factories for consistent test data
- Isolate tests with database transactions
- Clean up after each test
- Use realistic but non-sensitive data

### Assertion Patterns

- Specific assertions over generic ones
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Include negative test cases
- Verify error conditions

4. **Descriptive Names**: Clear intent from name
5. **Data Isolation**: Clean state for each test

### Performance

1. **Parallel Execution**: Utilize multiple cores
2. **Shared Setup**: Reuse expensive operations
3. **Smart Mocking**: Mock external dependencies
4. **Focused Tests**: Only test what matters
5. **Fast Feedback**: Prioritize quick tests

### Maintenance

1. **Regular Updates**: Keep tests current with code
2. **Refactoring**: Improve test quality over time
3. **Documentation**: Clear test purposes
4. **Monitoring**: Track test health metrics
5. **Training**: Team knowledge sharing

2. **Security Testing**: Dedicated security scenarios
3. **Performance Testing**: Load and stress testing
4. **Monitoring**: Real-time test health tracking

## Conclusion

This comprehensive testing strategy addresses the critical gaps in our current coverage while building a sustainable testing practice. The phased approach ensures rapid improvement in high-risk areas while establishing long-term quality assurance processes.

The focus on backend route testing (currently 0% coverage) is our highest priority, as it represents both security and functional risks. By following this strategy, we can achieve industry-standard coverage while maintaining development velocity and code quality.
