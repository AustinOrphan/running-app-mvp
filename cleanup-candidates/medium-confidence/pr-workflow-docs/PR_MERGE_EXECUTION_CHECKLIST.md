## üìù Phase 1: Feature/Bug PR Execution

### PR #289: Test Infrastructure Improvements

**Priority**: HIGH | **Risk**: LOW | **Impact**: Development workflow

#### Pre-merge Actions:

- [ ] Pull latest changes from main
- [ ] Resolve any merge conflicts
- [ ] Run the new test suite locally:
  ```bash
  npm run test:integration
  npm run test:e2e
  npm run test:a11y
  npm run test:visual
  ```
- [ ] Verify all 62 new tests pass
- [ ] Check test coverage meets threshold
- [ ] Review test execution time (<5 minutes)

#### Merge Execution:

- [ ] Create merge commit with detailed message
- [ ] Monitor CI pipeline completion
- [ ] Verify all status checks pass
- [ ] Confirm no regression in existing tests

#### Post-merge Validation:

- [ ] Run full test suite on main branch
- [ ] Update team documentation with new test commands
- [ ] Notify team of new testing capabilities
- [ ] Monitor test stability for 24 hours

### PR #293: Fix NaN Bug in Stats Page

**Priority**: CRITICAL | **Risk**: MEDIUM | **Impact**: User-facing bug

#### Pre-merge Actions:

- [ ] Test fix with various edge cases:
  - Empty run history
  - Single run
  - Runs with zero distance/duration
  - Invalid date formats
- [ ] Verify calculations are accurate
- [ ] Address inline style feedback:
  ```typescript
  // Convert inline styles to CSS modules/styled components
  // Ensure consistent styling approach
  ```
- [ ] Enhance type safety in mock API
- [ ] Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)

#### Merge Execution:

- [ ] Squash merge to maintain clean history
- [ ] Include comprehensive commit message with bug details
- [ ] Tag commit for easy rollback reference
- [ ] Monitor error tracking for NaN occurrences

#### Post-merge Validation:

- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Manual testing of stats page functionality
- [ ] Monitor error logs for 2 hours
- [ ] Verify no performance regression
- [ ] Update bug tracking system

### PR #281: Development Login Bypass Feature

**Priority**: MEDIUM | **Risk**: HIGH (Security) | **Impact**: Developer experience

#### Pre-merge Actions:

- [ ] Verify NODE_ENV checks are bulletproof:
  ```javascript
  // Ensure multiple layers of protection
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'development') {
    throw new Error('Dev bypass only in development');
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add additional safeguards:
  - Environment variable double-check
  - Build-time stripping for production
  - Runtime assertions
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Update .env.example with new variables
- [ ] Test production build excludes bypass code

#### Merge Execution:

- [ ] Regular merge (not squash) to preserve security review history
- [ ] Add security review approval in commit message
- [ ] Create git tag: `security-reviewed-dev-bypass`
- [ ] Document security measures taken

#### Post-merge Validation:

- [ ] Build production bundle and verify bypass code stripped
- [ ] Test development environment functionality
- [ ] Audit production deployment for any traces
- [ ] Update developer onboarding docs
- [ ] Schedule security re-review in 3 months

## üì¶ Phase 2: Dependency Update Batch Processing

### Batch 1: Development Dependencies (Low Risk)

**PRs**: #282, #285, #286, #288

#### Pre-batch Actions:

- [ ] Create temporary branch from main: `chore/dev-deps-update-batch-1`
- [ ] Cherry-pick all 4 PR commits
- [ ] Run full test suite
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes in:
  - Build process
  - Linting rules
  - Type checking
  - Test execution

#### Batch Merge Process:

```bash
# Create batch branch
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b chore/dev-deps-update-batch-1

# Cherry-pick each PR
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-282>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-285>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-286>
git cherry-pick <commit-hash-288>

# Validate
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test:all

# Push and create single PR
git push origin chore/dev-deps-update-batch-1
```

#### Post-batch Validation:

- [ ] All CI checks pass
- [ ] No console warnings during build
- [ ] Development server starts correctly
- [ ] Hot reload functioning

- [ ] Test each update individually first
- [ ] Check for security advisories
- [ ] Benchmark performance impact
- [ ] Review bundle size changes

#### Batch Merge Process:

```bash
# Similar process but with production deps
git checkout -b chore/prod-deps-update-batch-2

# Extra validation for production deps
npm run build
npm run analyze-bundle
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:integration
```
