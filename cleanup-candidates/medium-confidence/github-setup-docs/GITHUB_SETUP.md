# 🐙 GitHub Repository Setup

Your Running Tracker MVP is now ready to be published as a GitHub repository! Here's how to set it up:

## 🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended)

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

2. Click the "+" icon → "New repository"
3. Repository name: `running-tracker-mvp` (or your preferred name)
4. Description: `Full-stack running tracker web app built with React, Express, and Prisma`
5. Make it **Public** (so others can see your awesome work!)
6. **Don't** initialize with README (we already have one)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Connect Local Repository to GitHub

```bash
cd "/Users/austinorphan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/src/running-app-mvp"

# Add your GitHub repository as origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/running-tracker-mvp.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 Alternative: Use GitHub CLI (if you have it installed)

```bash
cd "/Users/austinorphan/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/src/running-app-mvp"

# Create repository and push in one command
gh repo create running-tracker-mvp --public --push --source=.
