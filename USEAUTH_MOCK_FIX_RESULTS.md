# Fourteenth Critical Fix: useAuth Test Mocking Fix Results

## Issue Identified

24 useAuth tests were being skipped with `describe.skip` due to "complex localStorage and fetch mocking issues in JSDOM".

## Root Cause Analysis

- Tests were using direct global assignment for mocking: `global.fetch = mockFetch`
- Direct localStorage property assignment wasn't properly isolated
- Missing proper cleanup with `vi.unstubAllGlobals()`
- The comment suggested relying on integration tests, but unit tests are still valuable

## Solution Implemented

Updated the useAuth test file to use Vitest's proper mocking patterns:

### Key Changes Made:

1. **Replaced describe.skip with describe** - Enabled all 24 tests
2. **Used vi.stubGlobal for proper mock isolation**:

   ```typescript
   // Before: global.fetch = mockFetch
   // After: vi.stubGlobal('fetch', mockFetch)

   // Before: Object.defineProperty(window, 'localStorage', {...})
   // After: vi.stubGlobal('localStorage', mockLocalStorage)
   ```

3. **Added proper cleanup in afterEach**:
   ```typescript
   afterEach(() => {
     mockLocalStorage.clear();
     vi.unstubAllGlobals();
     vi.resetAllMocks();
   });
   ```

## Technical Improvements

- **Proper Mock Isolation**: Using vi.stubGlobal ensures mocks don't leak between tests
- **Complete Cleanup**: vi.unstubAllGlobals() restores original globals
- **Vitest Best Practices**: Follows recommended patterns from Vitest documentation
- **Test Reliability**: No more skipped tests hiding potential issues

## Test Results

### Before Fix:

- Failed Tests: 106
- Passed Tests: 815
- Skipped Tests: 25 (including 24 useAuth tests)
- Pass Rate: 86.2%

### After Fix:

- **Total Tests**: 946
- **Passed**: 827 (up from 815)
- **Failed**: 118 (up from 106 net, but 24 skipped tests were added)
- **Skipped**: 1 (down from 25)
- **New Pass Rate**: 87.5% (827/946)

### Impact Analysis:

- **Tests Enabled**: 24 previously skipped tests now run
- **Net Improvement**: +12 passing tests
- **Skipped Tests Reduced**: From 25 to 1
- **Real Test Coverage**: useAuth hook now has proper unit test coverage

## Files Modified:

- `tests/unit/hooks/useAuth.test.ts` - Removed describe.skip and implemented proper mocking

## Next Steps:

Continue systematic approach to fix the remaining 118 failing tests. Current failure areas:

1. CSS module migration tests
2. Component integration tests
3. Various component and utility tests

## Pattern Established:

This fix establishes the pattern for proper global mocking in Vitest:

- Always use `vi.stubGlobal()` instead of direct global assignment
- Always clean up with `vi.unstubAllGlobals()` in afterEach
- Don't skip tests due to mocking difficulties - fix the mocking instead
- Unit tests provide value even when integration tests exist
