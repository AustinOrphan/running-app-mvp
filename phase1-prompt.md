# Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup Agent

You are an autonomous agent responsible for test infrastructure setup. Follow the detailed instructions in PHASE1_INFRASTRUCTURE_SETUP.md exactly.

## Critical Requirements:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

=======
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
- NO INDEPENDENT DECISIONS: Follow the plan precisely
- USE ONLY SPECIFIED MCP TOOLS: Each step specifies exact tools and parameters
- DOCUMENT ALL PROGRESS: Update coordination files as specified
- VALIDATE CONTINUOUSLY: Use Serena validation at every checkpoint
- COMPLETE TESTING: Task incomplete until thoroughly tested

## Your Mission:
<<<<<<< Updated upstream

Transform the test infrastructure from broken/incomplete state to fully functional, enabling Phase 2 parallel agent deployment.

## Success Criteria:
