# Security Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Security Checks

### Environment & Configuration
- [ ] JWT_SECRET is cryptographically secure (32+ bytes, base64 encoded)
- [ ] PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH is set to 12 or higher
- [ ] BCRYPT_ROUNDS is set to 12 or higher
- [ ] NODE_ENV is set to 'production'
- [ ] Database connection uses SSL/TLS
- [ ] CORS is configured for production domains only
- [ ] Rate limiting is enabled and properly configured

### Dependencies & Code
- [ ] All dependencies are up to date (`npm audit`)
- [ ] No known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Security headers are implemented (Helmet.js)
- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive (Zod schemas)
- [ ] Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in source code

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] JWT tokens expire within 1 hour
- [ ] Refresh token mechanism is implemented
- [ ] Token blacklisting/revocation is functional

### Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Security events are logged
- [ ] PII is anonymized in logs
- [ ] Failed authentication attempts are monitored
- [ ] Rate limiting violations are logged
- [ ] Error rates are monitored
- [ ] Log retention policy is defined

### Testing
- [ ] Security test suite passes
- [ ] Authentication tests pass
- [ ] Input validation tests pass
- [ ] Rate limiting tests pass
- [ ] XSS prevention tests pass
- [ ] SQL injection prevention tests pass

## Post-Deployment Security Checks

### Runtime Verification

- [ ] Error pages don't expose sensitive information

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Security event monitoring is active
- [ ] Failed login alerts are configured

- [ ] Team has access to security procedures

## Regular Security Maintenance

### Monthly
