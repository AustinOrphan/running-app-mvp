# Plan v001

## 🎯 Objective

Resolve all CI failures and establish a stable, reliable test infrastructure that maintains the 100% local test pass rate achieved.

## 📊 Current State

- ✅ Local: All tests passing (1115 unit tests, all integration tests)
- ❌ CI: Multiple failures across platforms and test types
- ✅ Database race conditions fixed
- ✅ Jest → Vitest migration complete

## 🔧 Phase 1: CI Environment Analysis (Priority: Critical)

### 1.1 Investigate Test Failures

- Check CI logs for specific error messages in failing tests
- Compare CI vs local environment configurations
- Identify platform-specific failures (Windows, macOS, Ubuntu)

### 1.2 Environment Variable Audit

- Verify all required env vars are set in CI workflows
- Check for missing test database configurations
- Ensure JWT secrets and other auth configs are present

### 1.3 Dependency Analysis

- Review package installation in CI
- Check for missing dev dependencies
- Verify Node.js version compatibility

## 🔧 Phase 2: Fix Core Test Issues (Priority: High)

### 2.1 Unit Test Failures

- Add CI-specific test configurations if needed
- Fix Windows path issues (if any)
- Ensure Vitest works correctly in CI environment

### 2.2 Integration Test Configuration

- Verify database setup in CI
- Check if maxWorkers: 1 is being respected
- Add proper database initialization for CI

### 2.3 E2E Test Setup

- Configure Playwright properly for CI
- Set up headless browser configurations
- Add proper wait conditions and timeouts

## 🔧 Phase 3: Performance & Quality Fixes (Priority: Medium)

### 3.1 Test Timeouts

- Increase timeouts for CI environment
- Optimize slow tests
- Add retry logic for flaky tests

### 3.2 Code Quality Issues

- Fix remaining lint errors (31 problems)
- Address TypeScript strict mode issues
- Clean up console.log statements

### 3.3 Performance Tests

- Configure performance benchmarks for CI
- Set appropriate thresholds
- Handle CI resource constraints

## 🔧 Phase 4: Long-term Stability (Priority: Low)

### 4.1 Test Infrastructure

- Add test result caching
- Implement parallel test execution where safe
- Create test performance monitoring

### 4.2 Documentation

- Document CI-specific configurations
- Create troubleshooting guide
- Update CLAUDE.md with test commands

### 4.3 Monitoring

- Set up test coverage trends
- Create alerts for test failures
- Implement flaky test detection

## 📋 Implementation Order

1. **Immediate**: Analyze CI logs and fix critical unit test failures
2. **Next**: Fix integration test database setup in CI
3. **Then**: Configure E2E tests properly
4. **Finally**: Address performance and code quality issues

## ⏱️ Estimated Timeline

- Phase 1: 1-2 hours (analysis)
- Phase 2: 2-4 hours (core fixes)
- Phase 3: 1-2 hours (performance/quality)
- Phase 4: 2-3 hours (long-term improvements)

## 🎯 Success Criteria

- All CI checks passing (green)
- Test coverage maintained at current levels
- No flaky tests
- All platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) passing
- Performance benchmarks established
