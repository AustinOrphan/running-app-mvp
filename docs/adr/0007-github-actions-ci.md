# 7. Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD

Date: 2025-07-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We needed a continuous integration and deployment solution that would:
- Run tests automatically on every push and PR
- Support matrix testing across different environments
- Integrate seamlessly with GitHub
- Provide good performance and reliability
- Be cost-effective for our usage
- Support complex workflows

## Decision

We will use GitHub Actions as our CI/CD platform.

Key workflows implemented:
- PR validation (tests, linting, type checking)
- Main branch CI (full test suite, coverage)
- Security scanning (CodeQL, dependency scanning)
- Automated deployments (staging/production)
- Scheduled maintenance tasks

## Consequences

### Positive
- Native GitHub integration
- No additional service to manage
- Free for public repositories, generous free tier for private
- Excellent performance with GitHub-hosted runners
- Large marketplace of pre-built actions
- Good secret management
- Matrix builds for testing multiple configurations
- Self-hosted runner support if needed

### Negative
- Vendor lock-in to GitHub
- YAML configuration can become complex
- Limited to GitHub repositories
- Debugging failed workflows can be challenging
- Some limitations on long-running jobs (6 hours max)

## Implementation Details

### PR Workflow Example
```yaml
name: PR Validation
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x, 20.x]
    
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        cache: 'npm'
    
    - run: npm ci
    - run: npm run lint
    - run: npm run typecheck
    - run: npm run test:coverage
    - run: npm run test:integration
```

### Performance Optimizations
1. Dependency caching
2. Parallel job execution
3. Test result caching
4. Docker layer caching
5. Conditional job execution

## Alternatives Considered

1. **CircleCI**:
   - Pros: Powerful, good Docker support
   - Cons: Separate service, additional cost
   - Rejected due to GitHub Actions' native integration

2. **Jenkins**:
   - Pros: Self-hosted, extremely flexible
   - Cons: Maintenance overhead, complex setup
   - Rejected due to operational complexity

3. **GitLab CI**:
   - Pros: Good integration if using GitLab
   - Cons: Would require moving from GitHub
   - Rejected due to GitHub preference

4. **Travis CI**:
   - Pros: Simple configuration, long history
   - Cons: Recent pricing/policy changes, performance issues
   - Rejected due to uncertainty about future

5. **AWS CodeBuild**:
   - Pros: Good AWS integration
   - Cons: Complex setup, AWS lock-in
   - Rejected for simplicity

6. **Vercel/Netlify**:
   - Pros: Great for frontend, zero config
   - Cons: Limited backend support
   - Rejected due to full-stack needs

## Workflow Best Practices

1. Keep workflows DRY using composite actions
2. Use workflow_call for reusable workflows
3. Implement proper secret management
4. Add timeouts to prevent hanging jobs
5. Use concurrency controls to prevent conflicts
6. Cache aggressively but invalidate appropriately

## Cost Considerations

- Free tier: 2,000 minutes/month for private repos
- Our usage: ~1,500 minutes/month
- Cost if exceeded: $0.008 per minute
- Self-hosted runners available if needed

## Security Measures

1. Use GITHUB_TOKEN with minimal permissions
2. Store secrets in GitHub Secrets
3. Enable Dependabot security updates
4. Use CodeQL for static analysis
5. Restrict workflow permissions
6. Audit third-party actions
