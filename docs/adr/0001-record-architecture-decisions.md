# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-07-28

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to:

- Provide context for future developers
- Document the reasoning behind key technical choices
- Track alternatives that were considered
- Maintain a history of architectural evolution

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs), as described by Michael Nygard in his article about documenting architecture decisions.

ADRs will:

- Be stored in `docs/adr/`
- Be numbered sequentially (0001, 0002, etc.)
- Follow a standard template
- Be written in Markdown
- Capture decisions that have significant architectural impact

## Consequences

### Positive

- Future developers can understand the context behind architectural decisions
- Provides a historical record of how the architecture evolved
- Helps avoid revisiting the same decisions repeatedly
- Improves onboarding for new team members

### Negative

- Requires discipline to maintain
- May become outdated if not actively maintained
- Adds documentation overhead to the development process

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Wiki-based documentation**: Rejected because it's harder to version control and keep in sync with code
2. **Code comments only**: Rejected because they don't provide enough context for major decisions
3. **No formal documentation**: Rejected because it leads to loss of context over time
